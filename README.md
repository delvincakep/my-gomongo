- GET all items: `GET http://localhost:8080/items`
- GET a single item by ID: `GET http://localhost:8080/items/{id}`
- POST a new item: `POST http://localhost:8080/items` with a JSON body like `{"name": "Item 1", "price": 10}`
- PUT an existing item by ID: `PUT http://localhost:8080/items/{id}` with a JSON body like `{"name": "Updated Item 1", "price": 20}`
- DELETE an item by ID: `DELETE http://localhost:8080/items/{id}`
